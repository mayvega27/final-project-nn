# Mango Leaves Diaseases Classification

Plant diseases are mainly caused by parasites such as fungi, viruses, bacteria, among others. The response of each plant to diseases is varied, so the correct diagnosis is sometimes complicated if the plant caretaker does not have sufficient knowledge to attack the problem. In agriculture, it is of vital importance to be able to make a diagnosis in time to avoid the spread of diseases and to prevent their reappearance in the future. In Colombia, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development does not provide training to farmers for the correct diagnosis and management of plant diseases, which hinders the disease eradication process. Considering the above, it is important to have models that can be used by farmers (and non-experts in general) for the diagnosis of diseases in all types of plants, and thus be able to reduce the negative impacts on Colombian plantations. In this project we use the data of 7 diseases in mango plants to train a ResNet-18 that has a Softmax activation function at the end that gives us a vector with 8 entries where each one represents the probability that the plant has a disease or is healthy.
